# Fake-And-Real-News

## Goal
The modern world is literally oversaturated with all kinds of information, and not always true. I decided to try to find the differences between real and fake news using analysis methods, including [Natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing#:~:text=Natural%20language%20processing%20(NLP)%20refers,same%20way%20human%20beings%20can).   

## The data sources   
To answer the task goal, I used [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) website. The Kaggle system hosts open data sets, cloud-based tools for data processing and machine learning. For my case, I found data with international news. These are mostly political news from 2015 to 2017. This data includes both fake news and real news, and that's exactly what I needed.
